Finalist entries to the O'Reilly Software Architecture Katas give us excellent examples of how to approach architecting software. No two are the same, despite following the same original brief. **How could you use these examples in your own work?**

## O'Reilly Architectural Katas

The O'Reilly Architectural Katas are hosted by [Neal Ford](http://nealford.com/) and [Mark Richards](https://developertoarchitect.com/), and judged by a team led by Head Judge [Jacqui Read](https://jacquiread.com/) (AKA Judge Jacqui).

Here is how the katas are described on O'Reilly.com:

> Architectural Katas (started by [Ted Neward](http://blogs.tedneward.com/)^) give you the opportunity to exchange ideas, solve an architectural problem, and, if you’re a finalist, present your plans before some of the best and brightest leaders in the industry.
>
> **Here’s how it works.** You’ll work together virtually in small teams of your choosing to solve a real software architecture problem faced by an actual organization working for social good. Everyone gets the chance to practice their craft in a safe and social environment, and the finalists and winners earn well-deserved bragging rights. Plus, the selected organization trying to do good in the world will have one of its gnarliest software architecture problems solved.
>
> Not ready to compete but want to be part of the action? Spectators are welcome! See how Architectural Katas work, cast your vote for the winning team, and learn how to successfully present architecture plans to stakeholders.
>
> **Please note, your team must include at least one O’Reilly online learning member in order to participate in the challenge and attend the live events.**
